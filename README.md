## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Developer Guide

The memory game requires a functioning Internet connection to load the font-awesome
and Google fonts libraries. The refresh button triggers a browser refresh to reset the
game state.

## Player Guide

Match all the flipped over cards to one another! After matching all cards, your star
score and time to complete will be displayed!
